# Password Manager

1. On running the ```main.py``` file, the required files will be created. Precisely ```secret.key``` and ```user_data.json``` files if they don't exists.
2. On the interface you can add password, get password, generate random password and exit the application.
3. As soon as you generate password, if will be copied to clipboard for you to use.
4. Password is stored in hashed format so, no one can see it in plain text.
5. The hashing is performed using the ```secret.key``` file.
6. You can change the some veriables like error message, instructions etc, form the ```constants.py``` file.
